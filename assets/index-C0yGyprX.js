Carved by erosion from red-tinged sandstone, the magnificent slot canyon in northern Arizona is still being shaped by the occasional water flow. In fact, care must be taken especially when exploring the canyon's lower level, since even a minor drizzle in this desert can herald a flash flood.A sacred space to the Navajo Nation that governs these lands, Antelope Canyon is accessed only by permit these days, generally on guided tours with tribal approval. But it doesn't take much exploration to see why this fragile formation carries spiritual significance to many, or why such care is taken to protect it.","copyright":"© JDay Photography / 500px / Getty Images","iconText":"Antelope Canyon in the Navajo Nation, Arizona","uri":"https://www.bing.com/spotlight?spotlightid=PageArizona&q=antelope%2Bcanyon&FORM=MC13ER","entityId":"128000000004928509"},{"landscapeImage":"https://res.public.onecdn.static.microsoft/creativeservice/37e9be36-962a-1443-c840-74aabc3310d7_desktop-b006_lavenderprovencefr_gettyimages-621123884_3840x2160.jpg","portraitImage":"https://res.public.onecdn.static.microsoft/creativeservice/10678926-554c-ad0c-4058-216c46c34849_desktop-b006_lavenderprovencefr_gettyimages-621123884_1080x1920.jpg","title":"Lavender love","description":"We can share this lovely sunrise in the South of France with you, but the arresting aroma of these blossoming fields may prove harder to get across.

Pinyon-juniper woodlands cover much of the mountain states' middle elevations between 4,500 and 7,500 feet, acting as a buffer between scrubby plains below and tall pines above. Often, pinyons and junipers are virtually the only plant life in these arid areas. Some specimens, like this Utah juniper in Capitol Reef National Park, attain impressive sizes (not to mention interesting shapes) despite the dry, low-nutrient soil.","copyright":"© Smit / Shutterstock","iconText":"Utah juniper in Capitol Reef National Park, Utah","uri":"https://www.bing.com/spotlight?spotlightid=DS_JuniperCapitolReef&q=Utah+juniper&FORM=MC13ER","entityId":"128000000005286529"},{"landscapeImage":"https://res.public.onecdn.static.microsoft/creativeservice/23191352-a9e1-98c6-2ff3-73d08a5539e6_desktop-b004_marblecavespatagonia_adobestock_347257728_3840x2160_1689173699685.jpg","portraitImage":"https://res.public.onecdn.static.microsoft/creativeservice/023ab7f2-25ba-7df8-de3f-1a355886a1c9_desktop-b004_marblecavespatagonia_adobestock_347257728_1080x1920_1689173699684.jpg","title":"A marble marvel","description":"It'll take a boat ride across a mountain-ringed glacial lake to get this view of Chile's Cuevas de Marmol, or Marble Caves.

Even so, a quick bite is rarely out of their long limbs' reach, since they spend most of their time up in the trees.","copyright":"© Tilo Grellmann / Adobe Stock","iconText":"Three-toed sloth in Costa Rica","uri":"https://www.bing.com/spotlight?spotlightid=ThreeToedSlothCostaRica&q=three-toed+sloth&FORM=MC13ER","entityId":"128000000004953289"},{"landscapeImage":"https://res.public.onecdn.static.microsoft/creativeservice/a39da56e-8811-81e5-3453-bb19f37106c9_2256728678588573196_128000000005230189_assets__landscapeimage_asset_1732530973691.jpg","portraitImage":"https://res.public.onecdn.static.microsoft/creativeservice/30d5f593-9128-6d54-9ed7-94d676560297_2256728678588573196_128000000005230189_assets__portraitimage_asset_1732530973170.jpg","title":"London","description":"Visit London for a perfect blend of tradition and innovation, offering something for every traveler.","copyright":"© TTstudio / Adobe Stock","iconText":"Travel to London","uri":"https://www.bing.com/search?q=Travel+to+London&filters=destinationcampaign:%22true%22&form=MC13JB&OCID=MC13JB","entityId":"128000000005230189"},{"landscapeImage":"https://res.public.onecdn.static.microsoft/creativeservice/d3bff726-b426-62be-fcc7-da47e3e5ca71_desktop-b003_kangarooislandau_gettyimages_1032901900_3840x2160_1690649953330.jpg","portraitImage":"https://res.public.onecdn.static.microsoft/creativeservice/b89be878-529c-feb6-bac9-7a95a80407d4_desktop-b003_kangarooislandau_gettyimages_1032901900_1080x1920_1690649953330.jpg","title":"A strange set of stones","description":"Kangaroos aren't the only critters you'll encounter on a trip to Kangaroo Island.

But as their liquid domain turns to a snow-swirled sheet of solid ice each winter, alpine Austria's sailors and windsurfers would seem to face two choices: Hang up the sails for the season or start booking flights. But a plane ticket isn't the only way to fly, which brings us to a third option: Harness those nippy winter winds and take to the skies. Bundled up and strapped in tight, these paraglider pilots control their specially shaped parachutes with cables, exploiting updrafts to reach great distances and heights. Skilled flyers can stay afloat for hours, taking in hundreds of miles of breathtaking (or breath-freezing) bird's-eye views.","copyright":"© P.

Should you get a chance to visit this Yellowstone hotspot at sunset, after the buzzing daily crowds thin, the terrace-like layers of microscopic life are still a compelling sight. These tiny yet hardy critters thrive in a spring that in some spots hits 188 degrees Fahrenheit—24 degrees shy of boiling, but still hot enough to pose extreme danger. So as the sun dips past the ridgeline and the sky dims, watch your step and don't slip.","copyright":"© Maciej Bledowski / Alamy Stock Photo","iconText":"Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming","uri":"https://www.bing.com/spotlight?spotlightid=DS_GrandPrismaticSunset&q=Grand+Prismatic+Spring%2C+Yellowstone&FORM=MC13ER","entityId":"128000000004945289"},{"landscapeImage":"https://res.public.onecdn.static.microsoft/creativeservice/b11554ed-fcbd-a2e5-4e25-f98c37613432_2256728678588573196_128000000005230409_assets__landscapeimage_asset_1732530974181.jpg","portraitImage":"https://res.public.onecdn.static.microsoft/creativeservice/57f24c9d-fc9e-0551-70a2-1e54f5c7ba39_2256728678588573196_128000000005230409_assets__portraitimage_asset_1732530974053.jpg","title":"Prague","description":"Discover the magic of Prague, where Gothic architecture, charming streets, and rich history create unforgettable memories.","copyright":"© joe daniel price / Moment / Getty Images","iconText":"Travel to Prague","uri":"https://www.bing.com/search?q=Travel+to+Prague&filters=destinationcampaign:%22true%22&form=MC13JB&OCID=MC13JB","entityId":"128000000005230409"},{"landscapeImage":"https://res.public.onecdn.static.microsoft/creativeservice/2ba1e921-91da-6e0e-5961-94f88f73c268_desktop-b006_buildingsbruges_gettyimages-126917921_3840x2160.jpg","portraitImage":"https://res.public.onecdn.static.microsoft/creativeservice/df6f0c51-e614-5d48-dd3f-8d8240c349d7_desktop-b006_buildingsbruges_gettyimages-126917921_1080x1920.jpg","title":"Bruges by boat","description":"This Belgian port town may be best known for its title role in the 2008 comedy-thriller In Bruges, but it's also famous for the charming canals that cut through its modest cityscape.

It wasn’t until 1893 that technology caught up with ambition and a canal was dug for maritime passage.
